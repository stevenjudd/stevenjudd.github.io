I am an IT Pro with experience with Windows administration going back to 1994.
I have most recently been a Cloud Architecture and Automation Advisor at Devon Energy Corporation.
I am a DevOps and Cloud focused Infrastructure professional.
I co-developed an internal training program for PowerShell at Devon Enegy,
and I spend free time learning more about PowerShell and other technologies and hanging out in the PowerShell bridge channel.

### Hobbies and such

I enjoy distance running as a hobby.
I started on a whim in 2011 when I completed my first half-marathon and have been running marathons since 2013.
In 2016 I completed the Dopey Challenge at Walt Disney World,
where you run a 5K, 10K, half-marathon, and marathon in four consecutive days.

I also like to mountain bike, but I haven't been in a while.
It is hard to mountain bike in Oklahoma,
where there are barely hills, much less mountains.

For my culture pursuits, I play the cello.
I actually have a music performance degree,
but I realized that I was not going to make it as a musician so I went into technology.
