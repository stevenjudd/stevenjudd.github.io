I am an IT Pro with experience with Windows administration going back to 1994. I have most recently been a Cloud Architecture and Automation Advisor at Devon Energy Corporation. I am a DevOps and Cloud focused Infrastructure professional. I co-developed an internal training program for PowerShell at Devon Enegy, and I spend free time learning more about PowerShell and other technologies and hanging out in the PowerShell bridge channel. #Bridge4Life

### Hobbies and such

I enjoy distance running as a hobby. I started on a whim in 2011 when I completed my first half-marathon and have been running marathons since 2013. In 2016 I completed the Dopey Challenge at Walt Disney World, where you run a 5K, 10K, half-marathon, and marathon in four consecutive days.
I also like to mountain bike, but I haven't been in a while. It is hard to mountain bike in Oklahoma, where there are barely hills, much less mountains.
I also play the cello. I actually have a music performance degree but I realized that I was not going to make it as a musician so I went into technology.
