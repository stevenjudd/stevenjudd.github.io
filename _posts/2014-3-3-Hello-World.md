title: Welcome to my blog!

This is where I'm going to drop my thoughts and ramblings about PowerShell (mostly) and other related stuff. I may even throw in some random topics here and there, but since what I like talking about is technology, it will probably be technology related. I hope you can relate to that. If so, does that make you my blog family?

Sorry, I forgot to warn you: I like dad jokes and bad jokes. "What's the difference?" you asked. Someone told me that you'd know when it becomes apparent. (Not my joke, but I like it so I'm using it.)

Feel free to follow me on Twitter and interact with me there. I also hang out in the [Virtual PowerShell User Group](http://poshcode.org/). I'm usually in the #bridge channel using Discord as the username **juddmissile**.
